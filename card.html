			<p>African bush elephants have very large ears and a trunk.
				The female elephants are very social animals. They live in herds of related
				females and their offspring. The adult males usually live alone and only
				approaching the females of a herd during the mating season. The matriarch
				leads the herd from water source to water source. There's a very strong bond
				between the individual herd members. If a females gives birth, the other females
				acknowledge the new member by touching it with their trunks. If a member of
				the herd dies, the herd stays with the corps for a while.
